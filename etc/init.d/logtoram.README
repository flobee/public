# Logs to RAM
(E.g. for the raspberry to reduce writes/ bring up SD Card health)

    mkdir /var/log_bak

    echo '# log to RAM'  >> /etc/fstab
    echo 'none        /var/log        tmpfs   size=30M,noatime         0 0' >> /etc/fstab


## Runlevels:

    # chmod a+x /etc/init.d/logtoram
    # update-rc.d logtoram defaults 9 99


possible problems to be checked:
 - logfs/ttmpfs must be mounted: OK
 - logtoram init script must be started befor services (e.g. rsyslog) using it: to be checked!
 - perms of logs must be verified, otherwise services can fail.
   eg. if "logtoram stop" fails after an important update or crash
   after installing new services you may run "/etc/init.d/logtoram sync" by hand to be sure all
   new logs und their perms will be reseted after a reboot
 - logrotate may leave old gz files which are not really nessesary. update rsync
   cmd of log to ram or limit logrotate configuration


if rsyslog is in use: update the init script:

    # vi /etc/init.d/rsyslog
    # add logtoram to the start and stop action:
    #       # Required-Start:    $remote_fs $time logtoram
    #       # Required-Stop:     umountnfs $time logtoram
    # save & close
    # update-rc.d rsyslog defaults
    # reboot
    #
    # NOTE: If services fail: check if the log dirs still exists. befor a reboot run
    # /etc/init.d/logtoram sync
    # and compare after a reboot eg.:
    # diff -rq /var/log /var/log_bak
