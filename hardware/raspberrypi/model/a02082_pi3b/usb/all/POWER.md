For this rpi it seems only the four usb ports can be de/activted.

wlan is still up when disabling it,
eth probably OFF when powering down for this raspberry version

Switching off frees usage of ~110mA on my rpi. 
 - Iddle (AC Adapter)  : 5.23V / 270mA, usb off: ~150mA 
   => 24h messurement: ~22W (While playing around with it)
 - Iddle (DC Powerbank): 5.04V / 268mA, usb off: ~153mA

Its a good reason to diable it when not needed :)
